Docker compose is used to run multiple containers as a single service.you could create a file which would start both the containers as a service without the need to start each one separately .
YAML is the file to configure your application’s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. 
Compose works in all environments: production, staging, development, testing, as well as CI workflows.

Benefits of Docker compose
• Single host deployment - This means you can run everything on a single piece of hardware
• Quick and easy configuration - Due to YAML scripts
• High productivity - Docker Compose reduces the time it takes to perform tasks
• Security - All the containers are isolated from each other, reducing the threat landscape
