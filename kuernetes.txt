PROMOTHEUS
it is used for monitor highly dynamic containeres environments, it constantly  monitor all the services,alertrs when crash,identify problems before.

PROMOTHES ARCHITECTURE
main component : promothesus server(does the actual monitoring work)
1.storage : stores metrics data(like cpu usage)
2.Retrieval : pulls metric data from the applications,servers etc.and send the data to the database storage
3.
 
service mesh :  service mesh manage communication between the microservices
microservices should communicate each other
each microsservices has there own business logic 
when the customer put some stuff in shooping cart request is recieved by web server next to 
when we add microservice to communicate with other one end point should be configured (communication confirguration comm)

challenges of a microiservice architecture
1. business logic(Bl)
2.communication confirguation(COMM)
3. security logic (SEC)
4.retrive logic(R)
5.metrics & tracing logic(MT)

security inside cluster
__________________
proxy is entry point to the cluster one's a request is enters into the cluster microservices get communicate each other but the data is insecure.

sidecar proxy:
handles the networking logic
acts as a proxy
third party application
cluster operators can be config easily

but service mesh as a control plane so it manage and control the proxy into the microservice part 
through these proxy microservices get communicate each other

Feartures of service mesh
(traffic split configuration)  canary deployment : when we need update a service but these service has bugs  which we doen't find in testing,we can;t end up the service instead of end it 10% is utilized and the rest 90% is of older version

istio architecture
consists of control plane and data plane

how to configure all the features for our services ?
it can be configure by kubernates YAML files 
it uses kubernetes customresourcedefinition (CRD)
the two main crd -------> virtualservice (route the traffic to a given destination)
                                     destinationrule (configure what happens to traffic for that destination)
we create a CRD  1(What is CRDs   (CRDs allow users to create new types of resources without adding another API server)
these istiod reads it and convert these high level routing  rules into envoy-specific confirgutions and send these confirguartion to all the proxy  

ISTIO INGRESS GATEWAY
-->entrypoint to your cluster it is alternative to nginx  (exess incoming traffic and load balancing)
